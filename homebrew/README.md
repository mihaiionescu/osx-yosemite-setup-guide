# Homebrew

Homebrew allows you to easily install hundreds of open-source tools. The full instructions are available on the [Homebrew Wiki](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Installation), but you should only need to run the command thatâ€™s listed at the bottom of the [Homebrew site](http://brew.sh):

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

After the instalation is done, run `brew doctor` to check that there were no problems.
