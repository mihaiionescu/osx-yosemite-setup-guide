##### Sublime Linter

[SublimeLinter](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installing-via-pc). **Note:** When you type 'linter' in the Package Control search, there will be entries named 'Sublime Linter'. Make sure to choose the one that has Sublime Text 3 in the description. We will go into details about this package in a separate section.

* SublimeLinter - Ruby
    * As we've already installed `ruby` and `rvm` is loaded in the **Terminal** app through our `~/.bash_profile`, we only need to restart Sublime Text 3.
