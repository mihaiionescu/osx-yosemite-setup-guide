# Sublime Text 3

Download [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) open the **.dmg** file and move the app into the **Applications** folder.

Too keep the app in the Dock, **right click > Options > Keep in Dock**.

You can add a shortcut to the Terminal so that you can open files and folders in Sublime straight from the command line:
`$ ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl`

Once you do that, you can open folders using `subl .` or files `subl /path/to/file/my_file`.

In the next sections we will add Package Control and setup Sublime further.
