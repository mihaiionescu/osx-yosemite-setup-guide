For installing XCode command line tools run the command

```

It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and now you have XCode and XCode command line tools both installed and running.

Open **Terminal** app (you can find it in **Applications > Utilities** folder) and run `sudo gcc --version`. This will prompt you to agree to Apple's XCode Terms and Conditions. Follow the on screen instructions.
