# System Preferences

First thing you need to do, on any OS acutally, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > Software Update**. Also upgrade your OS in case you want to work on the latest OS. Yosemite is a free upgrade so please check that. At the moment of this writing, the latest version is 10.10.1.

## Users and Computer name

* Login Options > Change fast switching user menu to Icon

## Display

I found that I like the possibility of having more screen estate on the Retina Macbook by scaling it, so chose to run my display at 1920. 

You can change this setting from **System Preferences > Display > Use scaled resolution > More Pixels**

## Dock

I personally prefer the dock position at the bottom of the screen, but you can easily change that to either the left or right of the screen from System Settings > Dock

## Finder

## Menubar

## Spotlight
