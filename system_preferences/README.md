# System Preferences

First thing you need to do, on any OS acutally, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > Software Update**. Also upgrade your OS in case you want to work on the latest OS. Yosemite is a free upgrade so please check that. At the moment of this writing, the latest version is 10.10.1.

## Users and Computer name

* **Login Options > Change** fast switching user menu to Icon
* Setup password, Apple ID, account image, etc.

## Trackpad

* Point and Click Tab
    * Enable **Tap to Click** 
    * Uncheck **Three Finger Drag**
* Scroll & Zoom Tab
    * Uncheck **Scroll direction: natural** - I am used to the "old" way of scrolling on Macs, but I got the "your scrolling the wrong way" plenty of times, so I'd say this one is optional
    * For any kind of photo/document editing, I consider useful having the **Smart Zoom** and **Rotate** options checked
* More Gestures Tab
    * I have **all** the options checked, but this again depends on your personal preference

## Display

I realised that I like the option of having more screen estate on the Retina Macbook by scaling it, so chose to run my display at 1920x1200. The other options for a scaled display are 1680x1050, 1280x800 and 1024x640, although I don't think there are too many people who would choose a smaller resolution than the original. 

You can change this setting from **System Preferences > Display > Scale > More Space** (1920x1200).

Instead of using a smaller screen resolution, consider using the Zoom function (**System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom**). You can trigger using your trackpad by enabling the **Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom** and choosing **Control** from the dropdown.

## Energy Saver

* Battery & Power Adapter Tabs
    * Increase the **Turn display off after** option to at least 5 mins

## Dock

I personally prefer the dock position at the bottom of the screen, but you can easily change that to either the left or right of the screen from System Settings > Dock

## Finder

## Menubar

## Spotlight

## Accounts
