# Install RVM and the Latest Ruby(2.1.5) and Rails (4.1.7)

## RVM

[Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io), is one of the most popular tools that allow you to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby and Ruby on Rails on the same computer.

You can install both Ruby and Rails using a single command with RVM, but because it also installs all the documentation, it is advisable to disable it in the beginning. Open **Terminal** and run:
`echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc`
